      <h2>As the Commissioner for ANC 1E06, I will work hard to improve government responsiveness, housing affordability, and road safety.</h2>
      <p>DC government takes a long time to address the needs of the community. It shouldn't take years to <a href="https://ggwash.org/view/81822/community-leaders-documented-over-375-sidewalk-repair-requests-heres-what-we-learned">fix broken sidewalks</a> nor should the city be removing public trash cans in areas that need them. I will focus my term on increasing quality of life in our district. I regularly submit 311 requests, have organized neighborhood cleanups, and helped neighbors with issues that they are facing with the city. If elected, I will make sure that District government hears the voices of my constituents and addresses our needs.  I will also regularly hold events to bring the community together. In the past three months, I have organized three neighborhood cleanups, two SidewalkPaloozas, and one ice cream social. With your help, I submitted over seventy 311 requests to the city to fix broken sidewalks, add trees, and fix crosswalks. If elected, I will spend my term pushing the city government to address the issues we have identified (see below map). I'd also love to work with you on an upcoming cleanup or local event!</p>
