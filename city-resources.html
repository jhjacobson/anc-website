          <h3>311</h3>
          <p>311 is a toll-free number that allows DC residents to request assistance with city services and information. This is the first place to go if you have a personal need (e.g. for a fire safety inspection or trash can) or request of a city agency (e.g. regarding a pothole or a rat infestation). The 311 call center is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You can also place a request online, at 311.dc.gov or through the 311 app. I recommend you include a photo with your online submission and keep the tracking number.
