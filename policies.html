          <h2>Housing Affordability</h2>
          <p>I am an advocate for more housing of all types throughout the city, and for increasing density that will allow us to create additional affordable housing units.</p>

            <p><a href="https://ggwash.org/view/81935/here-are-dcs-new-affordable-housing-income-limits-for-2021">DC has several programs</a> to help residents with housing affordability. <a href="https://dhcd.dc.gov/service/inclusionary-zoning-iz-affordable-housing-program">Inclusionary Zoning (IZ)</a> helps families with <a href="https://dhcd.dc.gov/publication/2022-2023-inclusionary-zoning-maximum-income-rent-and-purchase-price-schedule">incomes between 30% and 80%</a> of median income. The DC Housing Authority helps residents who make up to 30% of median income ($42,000 for a family of four).</p>
            
            <p>These programs are important to facilitating housing affordability. However, we have not produced enough units to make a difference. Getting through the waitlists for these programs <a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/06/24/dc-housing-authority-waitlist-voucher-funding/">can take decades</a>, which is unacceptable. If elected, I will advocate for the increased creation of affordable housing to make it possible for DC families to stay in DC.</p></article>

                <h2>Road Safety</h2>
                <p>There's no easy way to put it - DC's Vision Zero of zero traffic deaths by 2024 has been a failure. My wife and I primarily get around DC by walking and biking, and I worry that one of us will become a statistic as the result of inaction from city leaders.</p>
                    <p>If elected, I will focus on implementing more protected bike lanes, a dedicated bus lane on Georgia Avenue, and traffic calming measures to make roads safer.</p>
                    <p>A recent study found that speeding happens in school zones as frequently as other parts of the city. Asking dangerous drivers to not speed through school zones is not enough. We need to make it physically difficult to speed in these areas through better road design.</p>
                    <p>I will also advocate for the City Council to implement legitimate consequences for drivers who consistently create safety issues on our roads.</p>

            <article>
            <h2>Better Transit</h2>
                <p>If we truly want to reduce carbon emissions in DC, we must move forward with more environmentally friendly transportation methods. To do this, we need to make it easier to get around the city without a car. We need to envision our streets as a way to move people through the city rather than just cars. This will make it easier for drivers who need cars to get around the city with their car.</p>
                <p>Additionally, we need to increase bus service throughout the city by creating dedicated bus lanes on the center lanes of major roads in the city. Consequently, I am committed to implementing a dedicated bus lane on Georgia Avenue and will push for that to be in the center lane.</p>
                <p>We also need to recognize that cars can be a significant financial burden for some families, meaning our most vulnerable residents cannot afford them. More than 50% of the users of the Georgia Avenue buses are low-income. We need to make it easier for everyone to get around the city, and making our system more reliable will do so.</p>

            <h2>Rat Abatement</h2>
                <p>There have been concerns about the high number of rats in alley ways. I am already working with some residents to have inspections from the Department of Health to reduce the rat population in the area. The Department of Health runs a program in which, with permission from the property owner, they enter yards and remove rat burrows along with baiting the rats. If done in a widespread area, this reduces the rat population. If elected, I will continue to educate residents on this program and other methods to reduce rats in alley ways.</p>
                <p>I will also advocate for the city council to find more holistic and safer solutions to rat abatement. DC currently uses a rodenticide that can cause confusion in rats and lead them to die outside of burrows. If eaten by pets or wildlife, these dead rats can cause health issues for pets and wildlife. I will advocate for additional solutions, such as birth control and better trash cans, to reduce this risk.</p>
